# DSA210-Project

In this project I will be anyzing my sleep schedule over a three month period and compare it with the data of which activies performed at at night. Specifically, the goal is to determine whether reading a book late at night correlates positively with the time of the sleeping. A positive correlation would suggest that reading at late hours prolongs the time of sleep for this individual case. Data for sleeping hours will come from phone's health application and I will try to reduce margin of error for sleeping times. Obtaining data for books or other activities will come with more challanges. There will be multiple sources for data to choose (Amazon Kindle history, google history) and some personal insertions for the physical book data may be warrented.
