# DSA210-Project

In this project I will be analyzing my sleep schedule over a three month period and compare it with the data of which activies performed prior to sleep. Specifically, the goal is to determine whether reading a book late at night correlates positively with the time of the sleeping. A positive correlation would suggest that reading at late hours delays the time of sleep for this individual case.

Obtaining Data

Data for sleeping hours will come from phone's health application and I will try to reduce margin of error for sleeping times. Obtaining data for books or other activities will come with more challanges. There will be multiple sources for data to choose (Amazon Kindle history, google history) and some personal insertions for the physical book data may be warrented. I will try to get other activities prior to sleep by comparing phone activity time and time of the sleep.
